## API

`https://newsapi.org/docs`

*News API is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web. It can help you answer questions like:*

- *What top stories is the NY Times running right now?*
- *What new articles were published about the next iPhone today?*
- *Has my company or product been mentioned or reviewed by any blogs recently?*
---

## Algorithm

Based on Avast article *"How to identify fake news and prevent it from spreading."* `https://blog.avast.com/banish-fake-news-think-before-you-share`

**Algorithm is based on several factors:**

- What source does the piece come from, is it reputable?

- It has a catchy headline? 

- Is it current? Check the date to make sure you‚Äôre not ready to flip your wig (and someone else‚Äôs) over two-year old news, whether real or fake.

- It has an author?

**Users also can choose, according to intuition, if article is fake or true, by clicking buttons, placed on card with article**
